# Steam-Log-Collector

Steam Log Collector is a cross-platform C++ command-line tool designed to help users locate and collect log files generated by games installed via Steam. By specifying the name of a game, users can quickly identify the log directory and extract relevant data for debugging and diagnostics.

## Features

- **Game Discovery**: Automatically finds Steam installation directory and scans for installed games
- **Smart Log Detection**: Locates log files in multiple common directories across different platforms
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Multiple Log Types**: Identifies crash logs, debug logs, error logs, console logs, and general game logs
- **File Organization**: Copies logs to an organized output directory with timestamp and summary
- **Flexible Search**: Case-insensitive game name matching with partial name support
- **Detailed Output**: Shows file sizes, modification dates, and file paths
- **Interactive Mode**: Option to list all games or copy found logs

## Use Cases

- **Game Developers**: Collect logs from testers for debugging and analysis
- **Modders**: Retrieve logs to troubleshoot mod conflicts or issues
- **Gamers**: Gather crash logs and error reports for support requests
- **System Administrators**: Automate log collection across multiple games
- **Support Teams**: Quickly collect diagnostic information from users

## Prerequisites

- **C++17** compatible compiler
- **CMake 3.10** or higher
- **Operating System**: Windows 10+, macOS 10.14+, or modern Linux distribution

## Building the Project

### Windows

#### Option 1: Visual Studio (Recommended)

1. Install Visual Studio 2019 or later with C++ development tools
2. Clone the repository:
   ```cmd
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Steam-Log-Collector.git
   cd Steam-Log-Collector
   ```
3. Create build directory and generate project:
   ```cmd
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64
   ```
4. Build the project:
   ```cmd
   cmake --build . --config Release
   ```
5. The executable will be in `build/Release/steam-log-collector.exe`

#### Option 2: MinGW/MSYS2

1. Install MSYS2 and the MinGW toolchain:
   ```bash
   pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake make
   ```
2. Clone and build:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Steam-Log-Collector.git
   cd Steam-Log-Collector
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake .. -G "MinGW Makefiles"
   make -j$(nproc)
   ```

### macOS

#### Using Xcode Command Line Tools

1. Install Xcode command line tools:
   ```bash
   xcode-select --install
   ```
2. Install CMake (via Homebrew):
   ```bash
   brew install cmake
   ```
3. Clone and build:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Steam-Log-Collector.git
   cd Steam-Log-Collector
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
   make -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)
   ```
4. The executable will be in `build/steam-log-collector`

#### Alternative: Using Homebrew GCC

```bash
brew install gcc cmake
export CC=gcc-11
export CXX=g++-11
# Then follow the same build steps as above
```

### Linux

#### Ubuntu/Debian

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install build-essential cmake g++ git
   ```
2. Clone and build:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Steam-Log-Collector.git
   cd Steam-Log-Collector
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
   make -j$(nproc)
   ```

#### CentOS/RHEL/Fedora

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   # For CentOS/RHEL 8+
   sudo dnf groupinstall "Development Tools"
   sudo dnf install cmake gcc-c++ git

   # For older versions
   sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
   sudo yum install cmake3 gcc-c++ git
   ```

2. Build (use `cmake3` on older systems):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Steam-Log-Collector.git
   cd Steam-Log-Collector
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release  # or cmake3
   make -j$(nproc)
   ```

#### Arch Linux

```bash
sudo pacman -S base-devel cmake git
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Steam-Log-Collector.git
cd Steam-Log-Collector
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -j$(nproc)
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Search for logs of a specific game
./steam-log-collector "Game Name"

# List all installed Steam games
./steam-log-collector --list

# Specify custom Steam directory
./steam-log-collector "Game Name" "/path/to/steam"
./steam-log-collector --list "/path/to/steam"
```

### Examples

```bash
# Find logs for Counter-Strike 2
./steam-log-collector "Counter-Strike 2"

# Find logs with partial name matching
./steam-log-collector "counter"

# List all games first, then choose
./steam-log-collector --list
```

### Output Structure

When you choose to copy logs, they are organized in `~/steam-logs/` (or `%USERPROFILE%\steam-logs\` on Windows):

```
~/steam-logs/
└── GameName_20240101_143022/
    ├── 1_crash.log
    ├── 2_debug.txt
    ├── 3_console.out
    └── log_summary.txt
```

The `log_summary.txt` file contains detailed information about each collected log file including original paths, file types, sizes, and modification dates.

## How It Works

### Steam Directory Detection

The tool automatically searches common Steam installation locations:

**Windows:**

- Registry entries for Steam installation path
- `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam`
- `C:\Program Files\Steam`
- `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Steam`
- Additional drives (D:, E:, etc.)

**macOS:**

- `~/Library/Application Support/Steam`
- `~/.steam`
- `/Applications/Steam.app/Contents/MacOS`

**Linux:**

- `~/.steam/steam`
- `~/.local/share/Steam`
- `~/snap/steam/common/.steam` (Snap package)
- `~/.var/app/com.valvesoftware.Steam/.steam` (Flatpak)

### Log File Detection

The tool searches multiple directories for each game:

**Common Locations:**

- Game installation directory
- User profile application data folders
- Documents folder game subdirectories
- Proton/Wine compatibility layers (Linux)
- Platform-specific log directories

**Supported Log Types:**

- `.log`, `.txt`, `.out`, `.err` files
- Crash dumps (`.crash`, `.dmp`, `.mdmp`)
- Debug and trace files
- Console output files
- Any file with "log", "crash", "error", "debug" in the name

## Troubleshooting

### Steam Not Found

If Steam directory auto-detection fails:

1. Verify Steam is installed and has been run at least once
2. Manually specify the Steam directory path
3. Check the tool's output for searched locations

### No Games Found

- Ensure Steam has downloaded/installed games
- Verify the detected Steam directory contains a `steamapps` folder
- Check that `.acf` manifest files exist in `steamapps/`

### No Logs Found

- Some games may not generate traditional log files
- Check if the game has been run recently (some logs are created on launch)
- Logs might be in non-standard locations not covered by the search

### Permission Issues

- On Linux/macOS, ensure the executable has execute permissions: `chmod +x steam-log-collector`
- Run with appropriate permissions if accessing system directories
- Some Steam installations may require elevated privileges
